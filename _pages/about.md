This is Dr. Xueping Liang's home on the web!

Intro
======
I am a research scientist at Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center (VMASC), Old Dominion University (ODU).

My research mainly concentrates on security and privacy in the modern society. Topics include Blockchain security and privacy, Blockchain consensus design and application, cloud computing, IoT, and trusted computing. Besides, I also work on smart city security, power grid resilience, and data provenance.

From September 2015 to June 2018, I was a research analyst working under the supervision of Dr. Sachin Shetty in the Tiger Institute at Tennessee State University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in January 2019. I hold my bachelor (2013) degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology, China.
